- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), almost white, for a clean, professional look that ensures readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: A muted green (#81C784), lighter than the primary, to highlight important actions and interactive elements.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato) for the main content, ensuring optimal readability.
- Slightly bolder font (e.g., semi-bold or 600 weight) for headings and key information to create visual emphasis.
- Clear separation of sections using generous whitespace and subtle dividers for a well-organized and uncluttered interface.
- Simple, recognizable, and consistent icons (e.g., Material Design Icons, Font Awesome) for actions like 'edit,' 'delete,' and 'check-in,' enhancing usability.
- Use a responsive grid system (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox) to ensure the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Implement a consistent padding and margin system to maintain visual harmony and spacing throughout the application.
- Subtle animations and transitions (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
